=head1 Making a new release

CVS modules labelled with "CURRENT_TAG" below
need to be updated.  humpub tags are of the
format "humpub-release-##" - do a "cvs status -v"
on a file to find out what the latest used one
is.  Tag all the CVS modules with the current
release, then do a "cvs update -r CURRENT_TAG" in
the CVS modules.

Server files are in:

  /humsql/otter

on humsrv1 and for the test server:

  /humsql/test_otter

Client CVS modules and support files are in:

  ~humpub/otter

and test client in:

  ~humpub/test_otter

server requires:

  bioperl           0.72
  ensembl           branch-ensembl-19
  ensembl-otter     CURRENT_TAG

client requires:

  bioperl           0.72
  ensembl           branch-ensembl-19
  ensembl-pipeline  branch-ensembl-19
  ensembl-ace       CURRENT_TAG
  ensembl-otter     CURRENT_TAG
  tk                CURRENT_TAG
  PerlModules       CURRENT_TAG
  otter_config
  lace_acedb.tar

=head1 Upgrading to a new release

cd to each module directory and run:

  cvs update -r CURRENT_TAG

To ensure that you can overwrite files owned by
others in a group-writable checkout, you can use:

  cvs -d :ext:USER@cvs.sanger.ac.uk:/nfs/ensembl/cvsroot update -r CURRENT_TAG

Replacing USER with your user ID.

In the ensembl-otter module, the only files that
should have been modified on the server are:

    conf/species.dat
    scripts/OtterDefs.pm

OtterDefs.pm may need updating!

=head1 Backing out of an upgrade

cd to module directories and:

  cvs update -r PREVIOUS_TAG
